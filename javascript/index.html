<p>This game was created as a code challenge - built with JavaScript/jQuery.</p>

<p>This game was written in pure JavaScript (no jQuery) and was a personal code challenge project. Play it here: <a href="http://janmilosh.github.io/tic-tac-toe/">janmilosh.github.io/tic-tac-toe</a>. The player moves first and can choose the “easy game” option at the click of a button. In this case, the computer will always block a move or complete a row to win, but otherwise makes random moves.</p>

<p>During the player’s move, the cat image appears on hover and stays upon click. The player can change his mind and select a different position until the “Finalize Move” button is clicked. This then locks in the player’s move and allows the computer to make a move. If there is a win, an alert box appears and no more moves can be made. The “New Game” button clears the board without a page re-load.</p>

<p>Specially designed for use on smartphones, the <a href="http://janmilosh.com/productivity">Productivity Calculator</a> was built for therapists who are trying to meet productivity targets and need a simple way to calculate either their productivity or clock-out time. Total treatment minutes for the day are input, as well as clock-in time and optional lunch-out/in times. To calculate productivity, a clock-out time must be entered and likewise to calculate the clock-out time, a productivity must be entered. Instructions are provided on a separate page.</p>

<div class="post"><h1><a href="/portfolio-jekyll/music-chord-transposer-application.html">Music chord transposer application</a></h1><div class="content"><p><a href="http://janmilosh.com/transposer"><img src="https://janmilosh.github.io/portfolio-jekyll/images/transposer.png" alt="Music chord transposer" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://janmilosh.com/transposer">Chord Transposer</a> is a JavaScript application that I created in response to a challenge. Chords are input, separated by commas. The Key input is necessary for determining if the output key has sharps or flats. The new key and chord progression is output at the bottom of the page. </p>

<p>This app can handle complicated jazz chords as well as slash chords and can transpose either upward or downward in half-step increments.</p>

<p>Just for fun, there is a random background color generator button. With each click, a new background color will appear.</p>

<p>I was recently presented with a challenge to create a program that could evaluate two poker hands and declare a winner. This looked like a good opportunity to do even more, so I’ve come up with a JavaScript application that randomly deals two poker hands, shows the cards, and declares a winner. You can give it a try at: <a href="http://janmilosh.com/poker">janmilosh.com/poker</a>.</p>

<div class="post"><h1><a href="/portfolio-jekyll/color-palette-creator-web-applicatin.html">Color palette creator web application</a></h1><div class="content"><p><a href="http://janmilosh.com/color-palette"><img src="https://janmilosh.github.io/portfolio-jekyll/images/color-palette.png" alt="Take-Five Color Palette Application" /></a></p>

<p>The idea for my <a href="http://janmilosh.com/color-palette">Take-Five Color Palette Creator</a> came from the desire to create a color picking tool that I can really use on projects.</p>

<p>With the ability to choose (and keep) five colors on the screen at once, this application has practical value for anyone trying to come up with a color palette. If the user doesn’t care for a chosen color or wants fewer colors appearing, the clear button on each block brings the color back to black.</p>

<p>I built this with my own workflow in mind and will use it for inspiration in my own designs. It will be much easier and quicker than my old method of creating blocks of color in my vector drawing program. Hopefully others will also find it useful.</p>

<div class="post"><h1><a href="/portfolio-jekyll/loan-and-savings-calculator.html">Loan and Savings Calculator</a></h1><div class="content"><p><a href="http://janmilosh.com/time-value-of-money"><img src="https://janmilosh.github.io/portfolio-jekyll/images/tvm-calculator.png" alt="Loan and savings calculator" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s a little JavaScript project that I just completed. It’s a single page site that provides a calculator for comparing either loan or savings scenarios. Data can be entered in three different ways in each table such that the user can calculate either the payment (or deposit), loan (or savings) term, and loan (or savings) amount. The results accumulate in a table so that comparisons can be made. <a href="http://janmilosh.com/time-value-of-money">Give it a try!</a></p>
