[![D3.js weather graph]({{ "/images/weather-graph.png" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})](http://janmilosh.github.io/weather-graph/)

This [time-series weather graph](http://janmilosh.github.io/weather-graph/) was built with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) and jQuery. It presents a 36-hour, hourly temperature forecast for the user-specified location. The record high, record low, normal high, and normal low temperatures are all shown for comparison. The local time for the specified location is shown on the x-axis.

Weather Underground's autocomplete API is used for obtaining location details which are then used to query (WU) for the hourly, three-day, and archived forecasts (in a single request). jQuery is used for the API calls and for the autocomplete effects.
