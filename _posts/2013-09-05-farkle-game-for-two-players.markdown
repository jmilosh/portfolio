Farkle is a dice game for two players. I first created this game in Ruby (played on the command line). It begged to be written in JavaScript so I created this version. The logic is all JavaScript and the effects were done with jQuery. You can try it out [here](http://janmilosh.github.io/farkle-javascript).
