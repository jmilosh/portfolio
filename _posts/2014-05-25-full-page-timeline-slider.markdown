I built this jQuery [full-page, responsive timeline slider](http://janmilosh.github.io/timeline-demo)Â to meet custom requirements on a project. We needed a full-page responsive slider that could be used to demonstrate a company timeline. This slider also needed to work within a framework which had dynamically generated content. I was easily able to incorporate it into a Django project as shown [here](http://stratesphere.com/timeline).
